## Project Overview

This system is designed to automate several roles in product management and software development using agents powered by machine learning models. The main scripts simulate the following roles:
- Coder Agent
- Code Reviewer Agent
- Product Manager Agent
- Software Architect Agent


These agents interact with each other to simulate real-world project development, ensuring all components (code, documentation, architecture, etc.) are aligned.
